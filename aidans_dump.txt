Returns a copy of this tree that only includes leaf nodes if they are associated with the taxon objects listed in taxa. 
Note that this copy will be a “thin” copy, including just the basic structure (nodes, edges) and minimal attributes 
(edge lengths, node labels, and taxon associations). Annotations, comments, and other attributes are not copied.
